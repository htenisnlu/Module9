# Python Programs for Module 9: Lab Activity

This repository contains Python programs developed as part of Module 9 Lab Activity. Each program is designed to solve specific problems and demonstrate the use of various Python features and modules. Below are the details of each program, including their purpose, implementation, and example outputs.

## Problem 1: Infinite Loop

**Filename:** `Problem1Infinite.py`

This program creates an infinite loop that continually prints the word "Infinite". The loop will run indefinitely because the condition is always true.

## Problem 2: List of Numbers from 0 to 10

**Filename:** `Problem2NumList10.py`

This program uses a `while` loop to create a list called `L` that contains the numbers 0 to 10. The loop appends each value to the list until the counter exceeds 10.

## Problem 3: Sum of List Until Greater Than 100

**Filename:** `Problem3NumList35.py`

This program prompts the user to enter numbers, which are appended to a list. The loop continues asking for input until the sum of the list's numbers exceeds 100.

## Problem 4: Numbers Divisible by 10 Up to 50

**Filename:** `Problem4NumListDivide.py`

This program creates a list called `tens` that contains numbers divisible by 10 between 0 and 50. The loop checks each number and appends it to the list if it's divisible by 10.

## How to Run

Each program can be run individually using Python. Simply execute the Python files in your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python Problem1Infinite.py
python Problem2NumList10.py
python Problem3NumList35.py
python Problem4NumListDivide.py
